### Hi. ðŸŽ¶
I take part in open source software development here and there.

- ðŸ”­ I mainly work on [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper), [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion), and [Hangar](https://github.com/HangarMC/Hangar).
- âœ¨ I worked with egg82 to realize a <!-- really cursed -->MrBeast Gaming project of supporting 1000 players on one Minecraft server, now holding the world record of the most players on one:tm: server [at over 4000 players](https://i.imgur.com/0Zcllrb.png).
- ðŸ“† Server projects I work(ed) on are [Cytooxien](https://www.cytooxien.de/) and [OriginRealms](https://originrealms.com/).

If you're one of the people using the software I help maintain, please consider supporting me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kennytv/) c:
