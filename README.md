### Hi. 🎶
I am an upsidedown person taking part in open source software development here and there.

- 🔭 I mainly work on [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion), [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper), [Hangar](https://github.com/HangarMC/Hangar), as well as smaller projects like [Maintenance](https://github.com/kennytv/Maintenance).
- ✨ I worked with egg82 to realize a <!-- really cursed -->MrBeast project of supporting 1000 players on one Minecraft server, now holding the world record of the most players on one:tm: server [at over 4000 players](https://i.imgur.com/0Zcllrb.png).
- 📆 Server projects I work(ed) on are [Cytooxien](https://www.cytooxien.de/) and [OriginRealms](https://originrealms.com/).
- ❤ You can support me using [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kennytv/).
